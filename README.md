# Description


Initially, I attempted to install the latest version of Paper-QA2 with Python 3.12, first through the 
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/Future-House/paper-qa) and then via PyPI.
Unfortunately, as of September 21, 2024, the CLI was broken in both cases. Specifically, the `Docs` class was 
problematic. Queyring via `ask` worked fine. So, I decided to create a Python script to emulate the CLI. While 
this script doesn’t include all the command-line options, it does cover the most essential ones, but also provides
extra useful information than the CLI does, like the amount $ spent in each query and references.
Later I tried Python 3.11, with which the CLI is fully functional, but the script I started writing retains some unique
functionality that is available only through the API.


In the following sections, I will outline how to install Paper-QA2 and demonstrate a simple example using the included 
sample PDF file.

My overall impression of Paper-QA2 is positive; it answers questions thoroughly and avoids fabricating responses, 
unlike ChatGPT. If it encounters a question it cannot answer or fails to find the information in the provided papers, 
it simply states, "I don't know the answer," which I find commendable. However, the answers can lack broader context 
because they are solely based on the documents provided, rather than on the extensive prior knowledge that ChatGPT 
utilizes. Additionally, I am uncertain whether Paper-QA2 can query an online repository of papers, as it currently only 
operates with locally downloaded files, which limits its contextual knowledge.

Another minor drawback is that Paper-QA2 requires a separate subscription to the OpenAI API. Therefore, if you already 
have a subscription to ChatGPT, it won't be beneficial for using Paper-QA2. While there is an option to install a local 
LLM, I haven't ventured into that yet. I have already invested considerable time in getting Paper-QA2 to function 
properly, and I have reservations about the capabilities of the open-source LLM offered as an alternative to OpenAI's 
API on the [original GitHub distribution](https://github.com/Future-House/paper-qa).

# Installation
Follow these concise steps to set up a Conda environment with Python 3.12, install Paper-QA2 from PyPI, and configure 
the `run_paperqa2_Py3.12.py` script to run from any location.

## 1. Create and Activate a Conda Environment
Open your terminal and execute the following commands:

```bash
conda create -n paperqa_env python=3.11
conda activate paperqa_env
```

## 2. Upgrade pip and Install Required Packages
Ensure you have the latest version of pip and install the necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install openai
pip install paper-qa
pip install colorama
```

You are now ready to use Paper-QA2 through the CLI. For example, try:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='put key here'
pqa ask "What are the implications of SITAR for large proteins?"
```

If you want to explore extra functionalities that are available only through the API, then continue reading.

## 3. Prepare the Scripts Directory and Move the Script
Create the project directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/PaperQA2_project
```

Move `run_paperqa2_Py3.12.py` script to the project directory:

```bash
chmod +x ~/PaperQA2_project/run_paperqa2_Py3.12.py
```

## 4. Set the OpenAI API Key and Configure the pqa Command
Create an activation script to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable automatically when activating the Conda environment.

```bash
mkdir -p $CONDA_PREFIX/etc/conda/activate.d
```
Open `$CONDA_PREFIX/etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh` in a text editor and add the API key plus a shell function to 
override the CLI - which is installed by default but is broken - and run the Paper-QA2 script easily from any location.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='put key here'
pqa() {
    python ~/PaperQA2_project/run_paperqa2_Py3.12.py "$@"
}
```

**⚠️ Important: Replace 'put key here' with your actual OpenAI API key.

## 5. Add the Scripts Directory to $PATH
Enable running the script from any location by adding the PaperQA2_project directory to your system's `$PATH`.

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/PaperQA2_project:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## 6. Run the run_paperqa2_Py3.12.py Script
You can now execute the script from any directory using the following command:

```bash
run_paperqa2_Py3.12.py "What are the implications of SITAR for large proteins?" -p "." -a "about 300 words, but can be longer"
```

**🔧 Reminder: Ensure that all full paths in the pqa function and script locations are correctly modified to match 
your system's configuration.
